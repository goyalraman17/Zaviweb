It integrates at the system level, working in most applications. Wispr Flow offers a free Basic plan (2,000 words/week on desktop, 1,000/week on iPhone) and a Pro plan at $12/month ($144/year). It supports 100+ languages and works across apps like Slack, Gmail, and WhatsApp. Wispr Flow does not offer real-time translation between languages.',

It excels at answering questions, writing long-form content, analyzing documents, generating code, and brainstorming ideas.

        verdict: 'Zavi AI is the best Dragon alternative for general professionals. Dragon remains the standard for specialized medical and legal dictation.',
        verdictDetail: 'Dragon costs $200-500, requires Windows, needs voice training, and is designed for specialized fields. Zavi AI costs $7.99/month, works on all platforms including mobile, requires no training, supports 100+ languages with translation, and works instantly. For medical or legal dictation with specialized vocabulary, Dragon is still the best. For everyone else, Zavi is the clear modern choice.',
        competitorOverview: 'Dragon NaturallySpeaking, now owned by Microsoft through its Nuance acquisition, is the original professional dictation software. It\'s been the industry standard for 25+ years, particularly in healthcare (Dragon Medical) and law (Dragon Legal). Dragon offers extensive voice commands for editing and navigation, local processing for maximum privacy, and industry-specific vocabularies. Desktop versions (Dragon Home v15, Dragon Professional v16) cost $150-699 as one-time licenses and run on Windows only. Cloud-based subscriptions (Dragon Professional Anywhere at ~$55/month, Dragon Medical One at ~$99-200/month) are also available. Dragon Anywhere Mobile provides professional dictation on iOS and Android for about $15/month. Dragon\'s consumer product has been largely deprecated in favor of professional and enterprise editions.',
        whyZaviSection: 'Zavi AI is the best Dragon NaturallySpeaking alternative for the vast majority of professionals. At $7.99/month vs Dragon\'s $150-699+ (or $55/month for cloud), Zavi is dramatically cheaper. Zavi works on all platforms including macOS and Linux (Dragon desktop is Windows-only). It requires zero setup or voice training (Dragon needs a voice profile). It supports 100+ languages with real-time translation. The only area Dragon still leads is specialized medical and legal vocabulary models.',
        whoShouldSwitch: 'Switch from Dragon to Zavi if: you\'re not in healthcare or law; you want a fraction of the cost; you need more than 15 languages; you want real-time translation; you use macOS or Linux. Stay with Dragon if: you need Dragon Medical\'s clinical vocabulary, Dragon Legal\'s legal terminology, or enterprise compliance features.',
