        verdict: 'Zavi AI is the best Wispr Flow alternative for mobile users, multilingual professionals, and budget-conscious buyers. Wispr Flow has an edge in desktop voice editing commands.',
        verdictDetail: 'If you need voice typing on your phone — in WhatsApp, Gmail, Slack, or any mobile app — Zavi is the only option since Wispr Flow is desktop-only. Zavi supports 100+ languages with real-time translation versus Wispr Flow\'s ~30. Zavi costs $4.99/mo (with a free tier) versus Wispr Flow\'s $10/mo with no free plan. If you exclusively work on desktop and need advanced voice commands like "select the last paragraph" or "make this more formal," Wispr Flow\'s command mode is more polished. But for most users, Zavi offers more value at a lower price.',
        competitorOverview: 'Wispr Flow is an AI-powered voice dictation tool developed for macOS and Windows desktops. It lets you speak naturally and produces clean text with filler word removal and grammar correction. Wispr Flow\'s standout feature is its voice command mode, which allows you to edit text, change tone, and restructure paragraphs by speaking commands like "make the last sentence more formal" or "delete the second paragraph." It integrates at the system level on desktop, working in most applications. Wispr Flow is priced at $10 per month with no free tier. It supports approximately 30 languages but does not offer real-time translation between languages. Wispr Flow is desktop-only — there is no Android or iOS app, meaning you cannot use it on mobile devices.',
        whyZaviSection: 'Zavi AI is the best alternative to Wispr Flow for three key reasons. First, Zavi works on mobile — it\'s a full system keyboard on Android and iOS, meaning you get AI voice typing in WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, and every other mobile app. Wispr Flow simply cannot do this. Second, Zavi supports 100+ languages with automatic detection and real-time translation. You can speak in Hindi and get output in English, or speak in Spanish and output in French. Wispr Flow supports ~30 languages with no translation. Third, Zavi costs half the price — $4.99/month versus $10/month — and offers a generous free tier that Wispr Flow lacks entirely.',
        whoShouldSwitch: 'You should switch from Wispr Flow to Zavi AI if: you need voice typing on your phone (Wispr Flow has no mobile app); you work in multiple languages or need real-time translation; you want a free plan to try before paying; you want to save money ($4.99/mo vs $10/mo); or you use Linux (Wispr Flow doesn\'t support Linux). You should stay with Wispr Flow if: you exclusively work on Mac/Windows desktop and rely heavily on voice editing commands.',
        pricingComparison: 'Wispr Flow costs $10 per month with no free tier and no annual discount. Zavi AI offers a generous free plan for basic voice typing, and Zavi Pro costs $4.99 per month ($39.99/year). That makes Zavi 50% cheaper than Wispr Flow at the paid tier, with a free option that Wispr Flow doesn\'t offer at all. For teams and businesses, Zavi\'s pricing advantage becomes even more significant at scale.',

        competitorOverview: 'ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is the world\'s most widely used AI assistant. It excels at answering questions, writing long-form content, analyzing documents, generating code, and brainstorming ideas. ChatGPT is accessed through a chat interface — you type a prompt and receive a text response. While ChatGPT now offers a voice mode, the interaction model remains conversational: you ask, it answers. It does not integrate into other apps, cannot type in your email or messaging apps, and requires you to manually copy-paste its output wherever you need it. ChatGPT Plus costs $20/month.',

Zavi eliminates all of these steps. You speak inside the app you\'re already in, and the AI-polished text appears directly. No prompting, no copy-paste, no context switching.

        verdict: 'Zavi AI is the best Dragon alternative for general professionals. Dragon remains the standard for specialized medical and legal dictation.',
        verdictDetail: 'Dragon costs $200-500, requires Windows, needs voice training, and is designed for specialized fields. Zavi AI costs $4.99/month, works on all platforms including mobile, requires no training, supports 100+ languages with translation, and works instantly. For medical or legal dictation with specialized vocabulary, Dragon is still the best. For everyone else, Zavi is the clear modern choice.',
        competitorOverview: 'Dragon NaturallySpeaking, now owned by Microsoft through its Nuance acquisition, is the original professional dictation software. It\'s been the industry standard for 25+ years, particularly in healthcare (Dragon Medical) and law (Dragon Legal). Dragon offers extensive voice commands for editing and navigation, local processing for maximum privacy, and industry-specific vocabularies. However, it costs $200-500+ for a license, only runs on Windows, requires initial voice profile training, and has no mobile version. Dragon\'s consumer product has been largely deprecated in favor of enterprise-focused editions.',
        whyZaviSection: 'Zavi AI is the best Dragon NaturallySpeaking alternative for the vast majority of professionals. At $4.99/month (vs Dragon\'s $200-500), Zavi is 96% cheaper. It works on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux (Dragon is Windows-only). It requires zero setup or voice training (Dragon needs a voice profile). It supports 100+ languages with real-time translation (Dragon supports ~15 with no translation). The only area Dragon still leads is specialized medical and legal vocabulary models.',
        whoShouldSwitch: 'Switch from Dragon to Zavi if: you\'re not in healthcare or law; you need mobile voice typing; you want to save 96% on cost; you need more than 15 languages; you want real-time translation; you use macOS or Linux. Stay with Dragon if: you need Dragon Medical\'s clinical vocabulary or Dragon Legal\'s legal terminology.',
        pricingComparison: 'Dragon NaturallySpeaking costs $200-500+ as a one-time license (enterprise editions can be much more). Zavi AI offers a free plan and Pro at $4.99/month ($39.99/year). Over one year, Zavi costs $39.99 vs Dragon\'s $200-500+ — a savings of 80-92%.',
