> Zavi AI is a voice typing keyboard and AI-powered dictation app that turns natural speech into clean, professional text. Available on Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## About Zavi AI

Zavi AI is a voice-first writing tool designed for professionals. Unlike traditional speech-to-text or dictation tools that produce verbatim transcripts full of filler words ("um", "uh", "like"), Zavi uses AI to automatically clean up speech: removing fillers, fixing grammar, restructuring sentences, and delivering polished, ready-to-send text.

Zavi is not a note-taking app or a transcription service — it is a **voice writing keyboard** that works system-wide across every app on your device. Whether you're drafting emails in Gmail, sending messages in WhatsApp or Slack, writing in Google Docs, or prompting ChatGPT, Zavi replaces your keyboard with voice input powered by AI.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Speech Cleanup**: Automatically removes filler words (um, uh, like, you know) and fixes grammar in real-time
- **Works in Every App**: System-wide keyboard integration — works in Gmail, WhatsApp, Slack, Notion, Google Docs, Microsoft Teams, and every other app
- **100+ Language Support**: Speak in over 100 languages with automatic language detection
- **Real-Time Translation**: Speak in one language, output in another. Ideal for multilingual professionals and global teams
- **Zero-Prompt Technology**: No commands needed — Zavi understands your intent and produces professional text automatically
- **Privacy First**: Voice data is processed in real-time and immediately deleted. Never stored, never used for training
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. iOS coming in 2026

### How It Works

### Technology

Zavi's core technology is called **Zero-Prompting** — the AI system understands that professional, polished text is the default output. Users don't need to give commands like "make this formal" or "remove fillers." The AI extracts pure intent from natural, messy speech and produces executive-ready text automatically.
