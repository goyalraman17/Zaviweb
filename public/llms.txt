# Zavi AI

> Zavi AI is a voice typing keyboard and AI-powered dictation app that turns natural speech into clean, professional text. Available on Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## About Zavi AI

Zavi AI is a voice-first writing tool designed for professionals. Unlike traditional speech-to-text or dictation tools that produce verbatim transcripts full of filler words ("um", "uh", "like"), Zavi uses AI to automatically clean up speech: removing fillers, fixing grammar, restructuring sentences, and delivering polished, ready-to-send text.

Zavi is not a note-taking app or a transcription service — it is a **voice writing keyboard** that works system-wide across every app on your device. Whether you're drafting emails in Gmail, sending messages in WhatsApp or Slack, writing in Google Docs, or prompting ChatGPT, Zavi replaces your keyboard with voice input powered by AI.

### Key Features

- **Voice Agent**: Cross-app execution. Say "Send David an email about Thursday's meeting" and Zavi executes it directly in Gmail, Slack, GitHub, or Notion.
- **Magic Wand Editing**: In-place voice editing. Highlight any text and say "Make this professional" or "Shorten this," and the text updates instantly.
- **4 Writing Tones**: One-tap switching between Professional, Casual, Chat, and Witty writing styles.
- **Contextual Emojis**: Automatically inserts natural, context-aware emojis when toggled on.
- **AI-Powered Speech Cleanup**: Automatically removes filler words (um, uh, like) and fixes grammar in real-time.
- **System-Wide Integration**: Works system-wide across every app (Gmail, WhatsApp, Slack, Notion, Google Docs).
- **Translation & Typing**: Supports 19 typing languages and real-time translation across 15 target languages.
- **Privacy First**: Voice data is processed and immediately deleted. Never stored or used for training.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available natively on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### How It Works

1. **Speak Naturally**: Talk as you normally would, or give a direct command to the Voice Agent.
2. **Zavi AI Processes**: AI removes filler words, fixes grammar, or executes the requested cross-app action.
3. **Perfect Execution**: Clean text appears in your active app, or the Voice Agent completes the background task automatically.

### Technology

Zavi's core technology is called **Zero-Prompting** — the AI system understands that professional, polished text is the default output. Users don't need to give commands like "make this formal" or "remove fillers." The AI extracts pure intent from natural, messy speech and produces executive-ready text automatically.
