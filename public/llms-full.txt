# Zavi AI — Complete Product Information

> Zavi AI is the voice typing keyboard that turns natural speech into clean, professional text. It works across every app on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Detailed Product Description

Zavi AI is a **voice-first AI keyboard** that fundamentally changes how professionals write. Instead of typing on a keyboard, users simply speak naturally — with all the "umms," "uhhs," pauses, and messy phrasing that natural speech includes — and Zavi's AI instantly transforms that speech into clean, polished, professional text.

### What Makes Zavi Different from Regular Voice Typing

Traditional voice typing (like Google's built-in dictation or Apple's Dictation) transcribes speech **word-for-word**. If you say "um, I think, uh, we should probably, you know, meet at five," traditional voice typing outputs exactly that.

Zavi is fundamentally different. It is an **execution layer** and intelligence engine. It understands context, completely removes filler, corrects grammar, and formats it perfectly. But more importantly, it can **take action**. If you say "Reply to this email and tell David I am available at 5 PM," Zavi's Voice Agent executes that action directly within Gmail.

### Detailed Feature Breakdown

#### 1. The Voice Agent (Cross-App Execution)
Zavi sits directly inside your active applications (Gmail, Slack, WhatsApp, Notion, GitHub). You don't prompt it like ChatGPT; you speak naturally and it executes your commands:
- **Action:** Say "Send David an email about Thursday's meeting" and Zavi drafts and prepares the email.

#### 2. Magic Wand (In-Place Voice Editing)
- Highlight existing text in any app.
- Command: "Make this sound more professional and shorten it into three bullet points."
- Result: The text updates instantly in place.

#### 3. 4 Writing Tones
- Instantly switch between Professional, Casual, Chat, and Witty tones to match corporate or personal contexts.

#### 4. Contextual Emojis
- Optional toggle that analyzes the generated text and inserts natural, context-aware emojis for social media or casual chat.

#### 5. Real-Time Translation
- Support for 19 typing languages and 15 target translation languages.
- Speak in Spanish -> Instantly output perfectly formatted business English.

#### 6. Privacy & Security
- Voice audio is processed in real-time and **immediately deleted**.
- Audio is **never stored** and **never used** to train AI models.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my voice data private?
Yes, absolutely. Your voice is processed in real-time and immediately deleted after text is generated. Zavi never stores, shares, or uses your audio data to train AI models. Your conversations remain completely private.

### How is Zavi different from regular voice typing?
Regular voice typing (like Google's or Apple's built-in dictation) captures everything word-for-word, including all your filler words like "um," "uh," and "like," plus any awkward phrasing. Zavi is different — it uses AI to remove fillers, fix grammar, and automatically turn messy, natural speech into clean, professional text. No editing required.

### What's included in the free plan?
The free plan includes AI-powered speech cleanup, works in every Android app, supports 100+ languages, and comes with daily usage limits. Upgrade to Pro ($7.99/month or $49.99/year) for unlimited usage, 3x faster processing, and priority support.

### Can I cancel my subscription anytime?

### How does Zavi handle multiple languages?
Zavi supports over 100 languages with automatic language detection. You don't need to manually switch languages — just start speaking, and Zavi detects the language automatically. You can even mix languages in a single sentence (code-switching), and Zavi handles it intelligently.

### Can Zavi translate my speech in real-time?
Yes. Zavi can translate your speech from one language to another in real-time. For example, you can speak in Spanish and have the output appear as polished English text. This is ideal for multilingual professionals and global teams.

### What is "Zero-Prompting"?
Zero-Prompting is Zavi's core technology philosophy. Unlike other AI tools that require specific commands or prompts ("make this formal," "remove fillers"), Zavi automatically understands that clean, professional text is the desired output. You simply speak naturally, and Zavi produces polished text without any additional instructions.

### How fast is voice typing with Zavi compared to regular typing?
The average person types at about 40 words per minute on a keyboard and 38 WPM on a mobile phone. The average person speaks at about 150 words per minute. With Zavi's AI cleanup (which eliminates the editing phase), voice typing is approximately 4x faster than typing, saving an estimated 40+ hours per year for the average professional.

## Company Background

### Our Story
Zavi was founded in 2023 by Raman Goyal (CEO, University of Edinburgh) and Himanshu Kumar (CTO, IIT Kharagpur). The idea came from a shared frustration: both founders spent hours typing emails, messages, and documents when their thoughts came in seconds. Voice typing existed, but it produced unusable transcripts full of filler words that required extensive editing.

They built Zavi as fundamental voice input infrastructure — not another note-taking app, but a system-wide keyboard that understands speech intent, removes fillers, fixes grammar, and delivers perfect writing from natural speech.

### Mission
To eliminate the gap between human thought and written communication by making voice the primary input method for professional writing.

### Vision
A world where keyboards are optional — where anyone can communicate in perfect, professional writing just by speaking naturally in any language.

### Values
1. **User First**: Every decision starts with what's best for users. Privacy, speed, and quality are non-negotiable.
2. **Move Fast**: Ship quickly, iterate constantly. The best product comes from real-world feedback.
3. **Break Barriers**: Language shouldn't limit anyone's ability to communicate professionally. Building for 8 billion people.

## Technical Architecture Overview

Zavi's technology stack consists of three core components:

1. **Signal Processing & Intent Extraction**: Advanced noise filtering and filler word detection runs as a preprocessing step. The system then extracts pure intent from speech, separating actionable content from verbal noise.

2. **Zero-Prompt AI Processing**: Rather than using generic LLM prompting, Zavi uses specialized models fine-tuned for the specific task of converting natural speech patterns into professional written text. The system understands context, tone, and professional writing conventions natively.

3. **Context Compounding**: Over time, Zavi learns the user's professional vocabulary, communication style, and preferences, creating increasingly personalized and accurate output.
